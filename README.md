## Features✨
In this project, I aimed to understand JavaScript DOM structure and array methods. I want to talk about the features of the project. This project is a one-page quiz project. First there is the "Rules" section. When I click the start button, questions and options appear. There are five questions, one at easy level, two at intermediate level and two at hard level. I placed an warn box to show the difficulty level of the questions. Each question has a back and next button. When five questions are finished, the "Results" screen appears. Click the quit button and the "Rules" section returns.

## Design✨
I used SCSS technology while designing this project.

## Built With✨
I used JavaScript and SCSS technologies in this project. I used Prepros technology to see the SCSS codes working.

## Installation✨
````
git clone https://github.com/dilarauluturhan/reactive.git
````
## Usage✨
You must download Prepros to run SCSS codes. Then drag and drop the project into Prepros. Then you should open the cloned project in Visual Studio Code. With the Prepros application open, you can see the project at the port ``http://localhost:8848`` with ``CTRL + L``.
